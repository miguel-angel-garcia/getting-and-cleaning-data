# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data
This repo contains the course project files

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Files
There are four files in this repository:
* README.md (this file)
* CodeBook.md (describes the process)
* run_analysis.R (R script)
* activity_subject_means_measurements.txt (data file)

### CodeBook.md
Contains the detailed description of the data transformation.

### run_analysis.R
This R script manipulates the accelerometer data and generates the txt file. You can view more detailed information in the CodeBook.md file.

### activity_subject_means_measurements.txt
The data generated by the run_analysis script.
